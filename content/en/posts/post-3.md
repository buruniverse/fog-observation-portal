Today, something happened that wasn’t exactly *bad*,  
but left me with a faint, uncomfortable feeling.

It was nothing serious—  
just the kind of thing that lingers in your head  
and turns into a soft, cloudy unease.

When that happens, trying to *think* it through only makes things worse.

*They were rude.*  
*It’s my fault.*  

The brain is quick to slap labels on it like that.

So in moments like this,  
the best thing to do is not to think at all—  
just to *feel* the tangled threads.

You can stay at the level of bodily sensation:  
a tightness in the chest,  
a squirming in the pit of the stomach.  
That’s fine.

But you can also take it one step more abstract,  
and let your attention rest on the unease  
in a place that is neither thought nor body.

The important part is this:  
you only turn your attention toward it,  
and do nothing else.

Then, what remains is simply the fact  
that something happened  
and a tangled feeling arose.

And the feeling  
is no longer tangled.
