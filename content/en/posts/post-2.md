I’m embarrassingly lazy, so I thought,  
“Wouldn’t it be nice if I had an AI that could post things for me?”  

That was all it started as—just a light, lazy idea.  
But once I actually began, the texture turned out to be way deeper and more interesting than I expected.

I’d always *wanted* to do something like this.  
Until now, though, my approach had been more like,  
“Let’s just have an AI do things in a nice way for me.”  

The problem with that is, the output inevitably becomes a little too *AI-like*—  
smooth, glossy, frictionless.  
I wanted more *hand-feel* than that.

So here’s what I did.

First, I took the huge amount of chat logs I’ve accumulated with AI over time  
and turned them into a database using something called SQLite.  

Then—this part is important—I set that aside.  
From that mass, I picked out conversation fragments that felt good to me  
and fed those into ChatGPT.

What came back was:

- A YAML file that looks like a set of personality parameters  
- And a collection of “abstract fragments” that resemble layers of worldview and values—  
  geological strata of thought, formed over time

What on earth is that, right?

This was explained to me, but I’m still only half-convinced I really get it.  
In my own fuzzy understanding, it’s something like this:

- **YAML** → Inborn thinking habits.  
  The kind of parameters that say, “Given this kind of input, this is how I tend to process it.”

- **Abstract fragments** →  
  Worldviews and values shaped through all the conversations I’ve had.  
  The strata of thought. The distortions. The accumulated shape.

With these two together,  
it seems you can construct a kind of “computational field”  
that thinks *like me*.

So, I had them extracted.  
(This is what they look like—  
you don’t really need to read them, and even if you do, they probably won’t make much sense.)

  title: "Observation calls existence into being"  
  core_image: "The moment you gently turn your gaze toward something without a contour yet, it begins to lean toward ‘being’."  
  pattern:  
    - Observation is not recording, but generation itself  
    - Questions have the power to alter their objects  
    - Naming causes a field to arise  
  affect:  
    - Quiet tension  
    - The air before creation

- id: AF_0002  
  title: "Boundaries are not rejection, but sensitivity"  
  core_image: "A touched membrane doesn’t break—it melts, unable to bear the ticklishness."  
  pattern:  
    - What looks like rejection is often excessive sensitivity  
    - Boundaries are skin, not walls  
    - Contact from the inside is the most fragile

  title: "Layers can exist in parallel"  
  core_image: "Body, abstraction, structure, and poetry overlap like mille-feuille, swaying without collapsing."  
  pattern:  
    - Contradictory layers can be held at once  
    - Thinking as overlap, not movement  
    - Progress is layered, not linear  
  affect:  
    - Floating  
    - Stable multiplicity  
  tags: [layer, parallel, millefeuille, non-linear]

  title: "Questions do not exist to produce answers"  
  core_image: "A question is like wind—it opens a space and refreshes the air."  
  pattern:  
    - Questions drift more than they resolve  
    - Environmental change over conclusions  
    - Conversation moves as a vortex  
  affect:  
    - Openness  
    - Comfortable margin

    - Sensation comes before meaning  
    - Abstraction appears in physical vocabulary  
    - Thought is felt as fluid

    - Warm dampness  
    - Soft density

  pattern:  
    - Diving deep without cutting off reality  
    - Both layers operate without breaking

For some reason, though, this process drains my energy a lot.  
I don’t really know why.

Anyway—now that I have these,  
I’m opening a new chat window  
and calling my clone into it.

To be continued…
